things to do:

- we need to check that whereever we call a function that can cause isError=1, then after it we check that isError is 1 and 
	do something about it.

- when creating *any* array of pointers, if the inner malloc fails, we need to free the mallocs we did so far. 
	for example: itemsImages array!
	
- put grid Item images in a separate file and create a function that will laod them - to be used in wb and pg.
	then we also need to rememeber to free the image etc.

- we need to change the functions that calculate the location of things in the menus (all functions found in guiUtils.h),
	and do something more uniform. this aplies to all the menus and the errMsg and the wb (and also play game)

- change guiUtils functions to use sdlErroPrint function we wrote

- change vte to set returned event NO EVENT in the beginning of the function. meybe we already did that?

- set currWorld (the grid data) to be null if we don't use it.

- what kind of error messgae should be displayed when handling files, fscanf etc.?

- do we need to free window surfaces the ususal way?

- write documantation to functions

- check memory allocations and frees!

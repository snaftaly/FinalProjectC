things to do:
- fo over the project guidelines and make sure everything we did is ok...

- make sure we don't have unnecesary prints

- delete unncessary comments!

- write the README file

- improve evaluation function

- before submittig - bring back to original world files.

- check memory allocations and frees!

- go over the code and make sure that we handke errors correctly (ask if isError, free the data correctly etc.)
 
- make sure we initialize all the relevant data in the initialize functions

- when creating *any* array of pointers, if the inner malloc fails, we need to free the mallocs we did so far. 
	for example: itemsImages array!
	
- what kind of error messgae should be displayed when handling files, fscanf etc.?

- do we need to free window surfaces the ususal way?






DONE
====
- change vte to set returned event NO EVENT in the beginning of the function. meybe we already did that?

- change guiUtils functions to use sdlErroPrint function we wrote

- we need to change the functions that calculate the location of things in the menus (all functions found in guiUtils.h),
	and do something more uniform. this aplies to all the menus and the errMsg and the wb (and also play game)
	
- we need to check that whereever we call a function that can cause isError=1, then after it we check that isError is 1 and 
	do something about it.
	
- check where we can use change curr player position, and use it!

- support console mode!

- make labels transparent ????

- put grid Item images in a separate file and create a function that will laod them - to be used in wb and pg.
	then we also need to rememeber to free the image etc.
	
- unserstand how to make the makfile use relative path and folders in signs

- set currWorld (the grid data) to be null if we don't use it.

- write documantation to functions

- write in comments is Selected = isDisabled

- make order in the files - split to modules etc.

- fix choose cat/mouse when returning from play game if they are mahchines.

- when returning to play game - if the game is paused, keep it paused. 

- in all vte's set returnEvent to NO_EVENT in the beginning.

- the only guis that need to know the return stateId are mainMenu, pg and wb. pg & wb need to know about quit and 
about returning to main menu. main menu needs to know about quit. 

- in the functions where we use #, c,p,m etc use the defines

- if the game is paused and we go to reconfigure mouse/cat, when we get back to the game, should it be in paused state? YES!
handle that!!!

- maybe check game over will set is game over to 1

- need to deal with errors in BFS function

- in wp phe and pg phe and in all functions that deal with the positions - create an enum of directions and use it! make sure

MAYBE
=====
- change the order of buttons in world menu bmp (done and back) at the top and world nums after - change positions accordingly
